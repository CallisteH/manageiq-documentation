[[Planning_the_migration]]
= Planning the migration

During the planning phase, formulate a specific migration goal:

Example: "I want to migrate 2000 virtual machines, with 200 TB of data, in less than 6 months."

See the xref:Planning_questions[planning questions] for guidance in allocating resources. A xref:Migration_example[migration example] is provided so that you can estimate the time duration of the migration.

xref:Best_practices_for_migration[Best practices for migration] help you tailor the migration so that it fits your needs and schedule.
