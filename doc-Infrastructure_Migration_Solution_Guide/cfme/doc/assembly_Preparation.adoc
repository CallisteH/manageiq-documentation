= Preparing the environment for migration

Preparing the environment involves the following key steps:

. xref:Preparing_the_vmware_source_environment[Preparing the source environment] by extending the source network to the target environment and checking the source virtual machines for anything that might interfere with the migration process

. Configuring the target environment by setting up networks and storage, installing software, and adding the providers to CloudForms:

* xref:Preparing_the_rhv_target_environment[]
* xref:Preparing_the_osp_target_environment[]

. Configuring the conversion hosts to use VDDK or SSH:

* xref:Configuring_rhv_hosts[]
* xref:Configuring_osp_hosts[]

. Optionally, xref:Configuring_the_maximum_number_of_concurrent_migrations[changing the maximum number of concurrent migrations] for conversion hosts or providers for better performance and control of the migration process
