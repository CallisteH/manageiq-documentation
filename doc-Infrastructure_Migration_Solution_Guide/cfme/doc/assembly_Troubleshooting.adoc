// If errors occur for reasons unrelated to the infrastructure mapping or migration plan (for example, network outage), you can retry the migration plan or re-migrate previously migrated virtual machines. See xref:Retrying_and_remigrating[].

If the cause of the failed migration is not clear, see xref:Logs[] and xref:Common_issues_and_mistakes[].
