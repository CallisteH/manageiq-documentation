= Preparing the Red Hat Virtualization environment

Check the xref:Software_compatibility_matrix[software compatibility matrix] before you install the software.

To prepare the Red Hat Virtualization environment for migration:

. Ensure that the datastore has sufficient space for the virtual machines you are migrating.

. Set the BIOS settings of the physical hosts for optimal performance (rather than power-saving), according to the vendor's recommendations, and disable the C1E halt state, if applicable.

. Install  link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/html-single/installation_guide/#part-Installing_the_Red_Hat_Virtualization_Manager[Red Hat Virtualization Manager] on the Manager machine.

. Install link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/html-single/installation_guide/#Installing_RHVH[Red Hat Virtualization Hosts] or  link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/html-single/installation_guide/#Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_Hosts[Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts] 7.6 on the host machines.

. Enable the following https://access.redhat.com/articles/417343[ports] in the conversion hosts' network:
* 22 - SSH
* 443 - CloudForms, Red Hat Virtualization Manager, and VDDK
* 902 - CloudForms to VMware
* 5480 - `virt-v2v` to vCenter

. Attach  link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/html-single/administration_guide/#chap-Storage[data and ISO storage domains] to the data center.

[NOTE]
====
IMS only supports shared storage such as NFS, iSCSI, or FCP. Local storage is not supported.
====

. Upload the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/html-single/administration_guide/#Uploading_the_VirtIO_and_Guest_Tool_Image_Files_to_an_ISO_Storage_Domain[VirtIO and Guest Tool images] to the ISO storage domain. The VirtIO image file name must include the version number: `virtio-win-_version_.iso`. The Guest Tool image is used to migrate Windows virtual machines.

. Install Red Hat CloudForms link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.6/html-single/installing_red_hat_cloudforms_on_red_hat_virtualization/[4.6] (with RHV 4.2.7) or link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/html/installing_red_hat_cloudforms_on_red_hat_virtualization/[4.7] (with RHV 4.2.8) on the Manager machine.

. Add the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/html-single/managing_providers/#vmware_vcenter_providers[VMware] and link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/html-single/managing_providers/#red_hat_virtualization_providers[Red Hat Virtualization] environments as providers in CloudForms.
+
[NOTE]
====
Do not remove or change a provider before, during, or after migration because it will have negative effects on CloudForms.
====

. Configure the xref:Conversion_hosts[conversion hosts] on physical machines, not nested virtual machines.
