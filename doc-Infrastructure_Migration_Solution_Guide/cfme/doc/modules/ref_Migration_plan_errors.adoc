[[Virtual_machines_cannot_be_discovered]]
* If the virtual machines are being migrated for the first time and are not discovered by the migration plan, check the source datastores and networks in the infrastructure mapping.

* If the virtual machines have been migrated in the past, they cannot be discovered by the migration plan. Use a xref:Creating_a_csv_file_to_add_virtual_machines_to_the_migration_plan[CSV file] to add the virtual machines to the migration plan.

[[Virtual_machines_cannot_be_added_with_CSV_file]]
* If the virtual machines cannot be added to the migration plan with a CSV file, check the  xref:Creating_a_csv_file_to_add_virtual_machines_to_the_migration_plan[CSV file format and fields]. Create a new migration plan with the updated CSV file.
