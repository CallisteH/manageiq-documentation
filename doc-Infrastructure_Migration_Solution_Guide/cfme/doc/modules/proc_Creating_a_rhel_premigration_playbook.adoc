= Creating a `RHEL premigration` playbook for RHEL/Linux source virtual machines

If you are migrating virtual machines running RHEL or other Linux operating system, a `RHEL premigration` playbook ensures that their IP addresses are accessible after migration. The `RHEL premigration` playbook calls the Ansible `ims.rhel_premigration` role (see link:https://galaxy.ansible.com/fdupont_redhat/ims_rhel_pre_migration[] for documentation).

The `ims.rhel_premigration` role performs the following tasks on the source virtual machines:

* Preserves the static IP address configuration by creating udev rules to associate the virtual machine's MAC address with its interface name

* Red Hat Virtualization only: Installs the Red Hat Virtualization guest agent, which enables Red Hat Virtualization to report the IP address of the new virtual machine and to integrate it into the new environment

[NOTE]
====
The `ims.rhel_premigration` role assumes that either the `rhel-6-server-rpms` or the `rhel-7-server-rpms` repository is enabled in the source virtual machine when it installs `qemu-guest-agent`. If you have disabled the repository, re-enable it in the RHEL premigration playbook.
