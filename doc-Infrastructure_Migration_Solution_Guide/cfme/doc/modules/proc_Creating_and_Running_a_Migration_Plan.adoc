= Creating and Running a Migration Plan

.Prerequisites

* [[CSV_file]]Create a CSV file listing the source virtual machines if you are migrating a large number of virtual machines or if you are xref:Remigrating_Virtual_Machines[remigrating previously migrated virtual machines].
+
The CSV file contains the virtual machine names (mandatory) and providers (optional, to differentiate virtual machines with identical names) in the following format:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
----
Name, Provider
_vm01_, _vSphere3_
_vm02_, _vSphere3_
_vm03_, _vSphere3_
...
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are migrating a small number of virtual machines, you do not need to create a CSV file. The migration plan can discover and display a list from which you manually select the virtual machines to migrate.
====

* Check the target datastore to ensure that no virtual machine has the same name as a source virtual machine.

* Unmount ISO images from source virtual machines.

[NOTE]
====
A virtual machine will be in the same power state (`on` or `off`) after migration as it was before migration.
====

.Procedure

. Click menu:Compute[Migration].

. Click *Create Migration Plan*.

. Select the infrastructure mapping from the drop-down list.

. Enter the name of your migration plan.

. Discover the virtual machines:

* If you are using the migration plan to discover the virtual machines automatically:

.. Select *Choose from a list of VMs discovered in the selected infrastructure mapping*.
.. Click *Next*.

* If you are importing a CSV file:

.. (Optional) To validate your infrastructure mapping, select *Choose from a list of VMs discovered in the selected infrastructure mapping* and click *Next*. If your virtual machines appear in the list, the infrastructure mapping is correct. Click *Back*.
.. Select *Import a CSV file with a list of VMs to be migrated* and click *Next*.
.. Click *Import*, browse to the CSV file, and click *Open*.

. Select the virtual machines to migrate and click *Next* to go to *Advanced Options*.

+
(Optional) You can select xref:Automating_pre_and_post_migration_tasks_with_ansible[Ansible playbook services] to run on the virtual machines in the migration plan before or after the migration. For example, the xref:Ims_rhel_pre-migration_ansible_playbook_example[RHEL pre-migration playbook] performs several tasks to configure a target RHEL virtual machine. You must create the xref:Creating_an_Ansible_service_catalog_item[Ansible environment and service catalog item] before the migration plan.

. Click *Next* to go to *Schedule*.

. If you do not wish to schedule the migration to run at a certain time in the future, select *Start Migration Immediately* and click *Create*.

. Click *Close*. The migration plan may take some time to complete. The migration plan window displays *In Progress Plans*, the amount of data being transferred, the number of virtual machines being migrated, and the elapsed time.
+
To view the migration progress of individual virtual machines, click the migration plan name to display the migration plan details.
+
[NOTE]
====
During migration, the counter displaying the migration plan progress (in menu:Compute[Migration]) may be a few seconds ahead of the counter that appears in the migration plan details (menu:Compute[Migration>__Migration Plan__]). This is because the migration plan counter displays the total time to run the migration plan, while the migration plan details counter displays the time to migrate the virtual machines.
====

. When the migration plan has finished, check the status of the migration plan under *Completed Migrations*. The completed migration plan shows successfully migrated virtual machines. If error messages appear, see xref:Troubleshooting[].

[[Remigrating_Virtual_Machines]]
.Remigrating Virtual Machines

To migrate previously migrated virtual machines:

. Delete the target virtual machines corresponding to the source virtual machines that you are remigrating.
. Delete the disks that were created in the target datastore during the earlier migration to free up space.
. Create a xref:CSV_file[CSV file] to import the source virtual machines.
. Create and run a new migration plan.
+
[NOTE]
====
The virtual machines cannot be discovered automatically by the migration plan because they are marked in the CloudForms VMDB as `migrated`.
