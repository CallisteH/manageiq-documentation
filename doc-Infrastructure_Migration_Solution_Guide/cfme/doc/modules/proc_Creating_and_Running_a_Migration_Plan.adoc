= Creating and running a migration plan

The infrastructure migration involves the following key tasks:

. xref:Pre_migration_tasks[Pre-migration tasks]:

* *CSV file:* If you are migrating a large number of virtual machines, you can create a xref:Creating_a_csv_file_to_add_virtual_machines_to_the_migration_plan[CSV file] to add the virtual machines to the migration plan.
+
If you are xref:Remigrating_virtual_machines[re-migrating virtual machines], you must use a CSV file to add the virtual machines because the migration plan cannot re-discover them.

* *Ansible environment:* If you are using Ansible to automate pre- and post-migration tasks, you must set up an xref:Setting_up_an_ansible_environment[Ansible environment].

* *RHEL pre-migration playbook:* If you are migrating RHEL or other Linux virtual machines, you must set up an xref:Setting_up_an_ansible_environment[Ansible environment] and create a xref:Configuring_the_rhel_premigration_playbook[RHEL pre-migration playbook].

. xref:Creating_a_migration_plan[Creating the migration plan]

. xref:Running_a_migration_plan[Running the migration plan] immediately or scheduling it to run in the future

You can xref:Canceling_a_migration_plan[cancel] a migration plan in progress.
