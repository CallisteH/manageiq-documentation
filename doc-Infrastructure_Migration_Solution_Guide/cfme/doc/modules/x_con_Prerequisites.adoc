= Prerequisites

Before migration, your environment must have the following prerequisites:

Target datastore size::
The target datastore must have sufficient space for the virtual machines that will be migrated.

BIOS settings of hosts::
The BIOS settings of the physical hosts should be set for optimal performance, rather than power-saving, according to the vendor's recommendations. Where applicable, the C1E halt state should be disabled.

Red Hat Virtualization Manager 4.2.4 or later installed::
See the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/html/planning_and_prerequisites_guide/[Red Hat Virtualization Planning and Prerequisites Guide] and link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/html-single/installation_guide/#part-Installing_the_Red_Hat_Virtualization_Manager[Installing the Red Hat Virtualization Manager].

Red Hat Virtualization Hosts 4.2.4 or RHEL 7.5 hosts or later installed::
See  link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/html-single/installation_guide/#Installing_RHVH[Installing Red Hat Virtualization Host] or link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/html-single/installation_guide/#Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_Hosts[Installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux Hosts].

Network::
The VMware network must be extended to the RHV environment.
[IMPORTANT]
====
The network configuration must not be changed in any way during the migration. IP addresses, VLANs, and other network configurations must be the same, before and after migration, because the conversion process preserves the source virtual machine MAC addresses.
====

Ports::
The following ports must be enabled:
* 22 - SSH
* 443 - CloudForms, Red Hat Virtualization Manager, and VDDK
* 902 - CloudForms to VMware
* 5480 - `virt-v2v` to vCenter

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/417343[Ports used by Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine 5.1 and above].

Data and ISO storage domains attached to the RHV data center::
See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/html-single/administration_guide/#sect-Preparing_and_Adding_NFS_Storage[Preparing and Adding NFS Storage].
