= Creating a migration plan

[NOTE]
.Large migrations
====
A CSV file is optional, but recommended, for large migrations. Adding virtual machines with a CSV file is faster than manually selecting virtual machines for migration or selecting an OpenStack Platform security group and flavor for each virtual machine. See xref:Creating_a_csv_file_to_add_virtual_machines_to_the_migration_plan[].
====

. Click menu:Compute[Migration > Migration Plans].
. Click *Create Migration Plan*.
. Perform the following procedures in the *Create Migration Plan* wizard:

|Screen
|Procedure

|*General*
.<a|. Select an *Infrastructure mapping*.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you select an OpenStack Platform mapping, an *Instance Properties* screen appears after the *VMs* screen.
====

. Enter the migration plan *Name* and (optional) *Description*.
. Select a virtual machine discovery method:
* *Choose from a list of VMs discovered in the selected infrastructure mapping*
* *Import a CSV file with a list of VMs to be migrated*.
. Click *Next*.

|*VMs*
.<a|. If you selected *Choose from a list of VMs discovered in the selected infrastructure mapping*, select the virtual machines for migration.
+
If you selected *Import a CSV file with a list of VMs to be migrated*:

.. Click *Import*.
.. Browse to the CSV file and click *Open*.
+
Virtual machines with a duplicate `Name` field and no `Host`/`Provider` field to distinguish them, or with a duplicate `Name` field and duplicate `Host`/`Provider` fields, are marked with a red `x`. Correct the CSV file and create a new migration plan.

. Click *Next*.

If you cannot discover or import the source virtual machines, see xref:Migration_plan_errors[] for possible causes.

.<a|*Instance Properties*
(OpenStack Platform only)
.<a|. Click the pencil icon to edit the network or flavor of each selected virtual machine.
+
Flavors that are too small for the virtual machine are marked with an asterisk{nbsp}(`*`). If you have not created flavors for the migration, CloudForms tries to map the virtual machines to available flavors.
+
If you have added the virtual machines with a CSV file, the networks and flavors are already set.
. Click *Next*.

.<a|*Advanced Options*
.<a|[id="Advanced_options_screen"]
. Select a premigration and/or postmigration playbook service from the dropdown lists (see xref:Adding_ansible_playbooks_to_cloudforms[]).
. Select the virtual machines on which to run the playbook services.
. Click *Next*.

|*Schedule*
.<a|. Select a schedule option:

* *Save migration plan to run later*
+
The migration plan is saved in *Migration Plans Not Started* and will not run unless you schedule it (see xref:Scheduling_a_saved_migration_plan[]). You can click *Migrate* to run the scheduled migration plan immediately.

* *Start migration immediately*
+
The migration plan may take some time to complete. Progress bars indicate the amount of transferred data, the number of migrated virtual machines, and the elapsed time. See xref:Viewing_migration_plan_progress[] for details.
+
Optionally, you can xref:Canceling_a_migration_plan[cancel a migration plan in progress] or xref:Retrying_a_migration_plan[retry a migration plan] that was interrupted by external factors.

. Click *Create*.

|*Results*
.<a|Click *Close*.
|===

When the migration plan has finished, click *Migration Plans Complete* to view the status of the migration plan. The completed migration plan shows the status of the migrated virtual machines. If there are errors, see xref:Troubleshooting[].

In the migration plans list, you can click the *More Actions* icon (image:More_actions_icon.png[7]) to archive, edit, or delete a migration plan.

[[Scheduling_a_saved_migration_plan]]
== Scheduling a saved migration plan

. Click *Migration Plans Not Started*.
. Click the *Schedule* button of a migration plan.
. In the *Schedule Migration Plan* window, select a date and time and click *Schedule*. The plan's status is *Migration Scheduled* with the date and time.

[[Viewing_migration_plan_progress]]
== Viewing a migration plan in progress

. Click *Migration Plans in Progress*.
. Click a migration plan name to view its details, including the status of the migrating virtual machines.

[NOTE]
====
The counter in menu:Compute[Migration > Migration Plans] may be a few seconds ahead of the counter in the migration plan details view. This is because the *Migration Plans* counter displays the total time for running the migration plan, while the details counter displays the time for migrating the virtual machines.
====

[[Canceling_a_migration_plan]]
== Canceling a migration plan in progress

. Click *Migration Plans in Progress*.
. Select a migration plan and click *Cancel Migration*.
. Click *Cancel Migrations* to confirm the cancellation. The canceled migration appears in *Migration Plans Complete* with a red `x` indicating that the plan did not complete successfully.

[[Retrying_a_migration_plan]]
== Retrying a migration plan

. Delete newly created target virtual machines or instances, if any, to avoid name conflicts with the migrating VMware virtual machines.
. Delete newly created disks in the target datastore to free up space.
. OpenStack Platform only: Delete newly created network ports of failed instances.
. Click menu:Compute[Migration > Migration Plans].
. Click *Migration Plans Complete*.
. Click the *Retry* button beside the failed migration plan.
