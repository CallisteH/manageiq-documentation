= Adding Ansible playbooks to CloudForms for premigration and postmigration tasks

You can add Ansible playbooks to CloudForms to perform automated premigration and postmigration tasks on specific virtual machines, for example, to remove webservers from a load-balancing pool before migration and return them to the pool after migration.

CloudForms requires a minimum of one Ansible playbook repository, one playbook, and one set of credentials.
