= (Optional) Changing the maximum number of concurrent migrations

You can change the maximum number of concurrent migrations for conversion hosts or providers to control the impact of the migration process on your infrastructure.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For VDDK, the maximum concurrent migrations per conversion host should not be greater than `20`. Otherwise, network overload will cause the migration to fail.
====

The provider setting has priority over the conversion host setting. For example, if the maximum number of concurrent migrations for a provider is `20` and for five conversion hosts, `3`, the maximum number of concurrent migrations is `20`, not `15` (`5` conversion hosts `x` `3` concurrent migrations).

An increase in the maximum number of concurrent migrations affects all migration plans immediately. Virtual machines that are queued to migrate will migrate in greater numbers.

A decrease maximum number of concurrent migrations affects only future migration plans. Migration plans that are in progress will use the limit that was set when the plan was created.

To change the maximum number of concurrent migrations:

* For all conversion hosts:
+
In CloudForms, click menu:Compute[Migration > Migration Settings] and select the new limit.

[NOTE]
====
The following commands are performed on the command line of the CloudForms machine.
====

* For a specific conversion host (`20` in this example):

irb(main):002:0> $evm.vmdb(:host).find_by(:name => "_host1.example.com_").custom_set("Max Transformation Runners", _20_)

To get the maximum number of concurrent migrations for a provider:
