== Installing and configuring Red Hat Virtualization

. Install Red Hat Virtualization Manager 4.2 on the Manager machine (see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/html-single/installation_guide/#part-Installing_the_Red_Hat_Virtualization_Manager[Installing the Red Hat Virtualization Manager] in the _Red Hat Virtualization Installation Guide_).

. Install Red Hat Virtualization Host 4.2 or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 on physical machines (see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/html-single/installation_guide/#Installing_RHVH[Installing Red Hat Virtualization Host] or link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/html-single/installation_guide/#Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_Hosts[Installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux Hosts] in the _Red Hat Virtualization Installation Guide_).
+
[NOTE]
====
Some of these hosts will be deployed as conversion hosts. The number of conversion hosts depends on your migration size and infrastructure capabilities. See xref:Number_of_conversion_hosts[] for details.
====

. Enable the following ports in the conversion host network (see https://access.redhat.com/articles/417343[]):
* 22 - SSH
* 443 - CloudForms, Red Hat Virtualization Manager, and VDDK
* 902 - CloudForms to VMware
* 5480 - `virt-v2v` to vCenter

. Create and attach data and ISO storage domains to the data center, ensuring that the data domain has sufficient space for the migrated virtual machines (see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/html-single/administration_guide/#chap-Storage[Storage] in the _Red Hat Virtualization Administration Guide_).
+
[NOTE]
====
IMS only supports shared storage, such as NFS, iSCSI, or FCP. Local storage is not supported.
====

. Upload the VirtIO and Guest Tool image files to the ISO storage domain (see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/html-single/administration_guide/#Uploading_the_VirtIO_and_Guest_Tool_Image_Files_to_an_ISO_Storage_Domain[Uploading the VirtIO and Guest Tool Image Files to an ISO Storage Domain] in the _Red Hat Virtualization Administration Guide_).
+
The VirtIO file name must include the version number: +virtio-win-_version_.iso+. The Guest Tool is required for migrating Windows virtual machines.

. If you are using SSSD with single sign-on, reinstall `ipa-client` without configuring the OpenSSH client:[[Reinstalling_ipa_client]]
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
----
# ipa-client-install --uninstall
# ipa-client-install --no-ssh
----
+
Otherwise, SSH will fail for the vdsm user (see link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1544379[]). This issue cannot be resolved by modifying the configuration file because the file is restored during upgrades.
endif::rhv[]
ifdef::osp[]
== Installing and configuring OpenStack Platform

. Install Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 or 14 (see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/14/html-single/director_installation_and_usage/[Red Hat OpenStack Platform Director Installation and Usage]).

. Create provider networks for the target instances to preserve the IP addresses of the source virtual machines (see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/14/html-single/networking_guide/#create_a_network[Create a network] in the _Red Hat OpenStack Platform Networking Guide_).

. Create a project for the conversion hosts and whatever destination projects you require for the target instances (see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/14/html-single/users_and_identity_management_guide/#create_a_project[Create a Project] in the _Red Hat OpenStack Platform Users and Identity Management Guide_).

. Ensure that the `admin` user has `member` and `admin` roles in the conversion and destination projects (see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/14/html-single/users_and_identity_management_guide/#edit_a_project[Edit a Project] in the _Red Hat OpenStack Platform Users and Identity Management Guide_).

. Set at least one volume type for the target block storage (see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/14/html-single/storage_guide/#section-create-volume[Create a Volume] and link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/14/html-single/storage_guide/#section-volume-retype[Changing a Volumeâ€™s Type (Volume Re-typing)] in the _Red Hat OpenStack Platform Storage Guide_). Otherwise, CloudForms cannot detect the storage when you create the infrastructure mapping.

. Ensure that the storage backends have sufficient space for the migrated virtual machines.

. Configure security groups with the following ports enabled:

* For the conversion hosts and CloudForms: port 22 (SSH)
* For CloudForms: port 443 (HTTPS)
+
[NOTE]
====
Outbound traffic is enabled by default. If you have changed this setting, enable ports 902 (CloudForms to VMware) and 5480 (`virt-v2v` to vCenter).
====

. Create flavors for the source virtual machines. If you do not create custom flavors, CloudForms will try to map each source virtual machine to an existing flavor.
endif::osp[]

== Installing and configuring CloudForms

ifdef::rhv[]
. Install Red Hat CloudForms 4.7 on the Manager machine (see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/html/installing_red_hat_cloudforms_on_red_hat_virtualization[Installing Red Hat CloudForms on Red Hat Virtualization]).

. Add VMware and Red Hat Virtualization as providers (see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/html-single/managing_providers/#vmware_vcenter_providers[Adding a VMware vCenter Provider] and link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/html-single/managing_providers/#adding_a_red_hat_virtualization_provider[Adding a Red Hat Virtualization Provider] in _Red Hat CloudForms: Managing Providers_) .
+
[NOTE]
====
Removing or changing a provider, including refreshing hosts, before, during, or after the migration will cause errors in the infrastructure mappings and migration plans.

== Deploying OpenStack Platform conversion hosts

You download the conversion host appliance and use it to deploy the conversion host instances. The number of conversion hosts you deploy depends on your migration size and infrastructure capabilities. See xref:Number_of_conversion_hosts[] for details.

. Navigate to link:https://access.redhat.com/downloads/[].
. In the *A-Z* tab, click *Red Hat OpenStack Platform*.
. Click the green *Download Latest* button to go to the OpenStack Platform download page.
. Click the *Product Software* tab and download the `RHOSP V2V Image for Red Hat OpenStack Director (x86_64)`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Always download the latest version of the OpenStack Platform conversion appliance because it contains patches and fixes. The OpenStack Platform 14 conversion appliance can be used with both OpenStack Platform 13 and 14.
====

. Upload the appliance to Glance storage.
. Deploy the appliance as a conversion host instance, with the following resources:
+
** 4 vCPUs
** 8 GB RAM
** `/tmp` (1 GB for each conversion)
** `/var/tmp` (1 GB for each conversion)
** `/var/logs` (5 GB)
+
[NOTE]
====
For optimal performance:

* Deploy the conversion hosts on more than one hypervisor.
* Deploy the conversion hosts on a compute node with nested virtualization enabled. See link:https://docs.openstack.org/devstack/latest/guides/devstack-with-nested-kvm.html[]. Nested virtualization is a technology preview.
