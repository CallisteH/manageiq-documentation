= Preparing the RHV Conversion Hosts

Before you create the RHV conversion hosts, you must decide xref:Number_of_conversion_hosts[how many conversion hosts] you need and which datapath transformation option, xref:datapath_transformation_options_vddk_ssh[VDDK or SSH], to use.

[[Number_of_conversion_hosts]]
.Number of RHV Conversion Hosts

Because all the virtual machines are migrated at the same time, the number of RHV conversion hosts you require depends on the number of virtual machines you are migrating. Multiple conversion hosts are recommended, even for smaller migrations, for load-balancing purposes.

The number of virtual machines that you can migrate simultaneously depends on your infrastructure capabilities. Each migration requires a certain amount of network bandwidth, I/O throughput, and processing power for the conversion process. You should thoroughly test your environment before the migration to determine how many migrations it can support without negative effects.

You must configure the RHV conversion hosts on physical machines, not nested virtual machines.

Each conversion host is limited to `10` concurrent migrations, unless you  xref:Configuring_the_maximum_number_of_concurrent_migrations[change the default value].

[IMPORTANT]
====
The maximum number of concurrent virtual machine migrations per conversion host is `10`, for VDDK transformation, and `20`, for SSH transformation. The SSH transformation limitation, however, applies only to RHV 4.2.5, not to later versions of RHV.

[[datapath_transformation_options_vddk_ssh]]
.Datapath Transformation Options: VDDK or SSH

You must choose the datapath transformation option, VDDK or SSH, that is appropriate for your migration size and setup:

VDDK::
* Recommended because it is approximately twice as fast as SSH
* Compiled with `nbdkit` to provide direct connectivity to the virtual machine disks
* Requires VDDK package download
* Conversion host configuration requires a location
* Each conversion host supports only 10 concurrent migrations

SSH::
* Does not require additional downloads, packages, tools, or compilation
* RHV and VMware environments must share SSH keys
* SSH access must be enabled on ESXi hosts
* Slower than VDDK
* Better suited for large-scale migrations than VDDK
