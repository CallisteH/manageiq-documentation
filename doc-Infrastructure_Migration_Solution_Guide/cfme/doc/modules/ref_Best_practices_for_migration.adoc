= Best Practices for Migration

* Run the xref:Ims_rhel_pre-migration_ansible_playbook_example[IMS RHEL pre-migration Ansible playbook] to preserve static IP address configuration and to install the RHV guest agent. See xref:Automating_pre_and_post_migration_tasks_with_ansible[] for more information.

* Create migration groups, so that you are not migrating all of your virtual machines at the same time. The following questions provide guidelines:

** How are the virtual machines grouped now?
** Which virtual machines should be migrated together?
** What workloads should be migrated together?
** What applications must remain available?

* Consider which parts of the workload to migrate first:

** Databases
** Applications
** Web servers
** Load balancers

* Keep linked applications together, so that they migrate at the same time.

* Reboot or delete snapshots before the migration, to reduce the risk of failure.

* Schedule your migration carefully, to minimize the impact on your users.

* Stagger the migration schedules.

* Move critical applications during maintenance windows.

* Plan for redundancy.

* Ensure that you have sufficient space for the migration. The migration process does not delete the original virtual machines.

* Minimize the impact on your environment by creating multiple migration plans to control and throttle the migration process.

* Prepare your users for downtime.
