= Retrying and re-migrating

When virtual machines fail to migrate, the migration plan's status is `Failed`. You must clean up the target environment if the migration failed during the conversion phase retrying a failed migration plan or re-migrating virtual machines.

.Cleaning up a failed migration

. Delete newly created target virtual machines or instances to avoid name conflicts with source virtual machines.
. Delete newly created disks in the target datastore to free up space.
. OpenStack Platform only: Delete newly created network ports of failed instances.

.Retrying a failed migration plan

If the source virtual machines have never been migrated, you can retry the failed migration plan:

. Click menu:Compute[Migration > Migration Plans].
. Click `Migration Plans Complete`.
. Click the `Retry` button beside the failed migration plan.

[[Remigrating_virtual_machines]]
.Re-migrating virtual machines

If the virtual machines have been migrated previously, you must re-migrate the virtual machines using a CSV file:

. Create a xref:Creating_a_csv_file_to_add_virtual_machines_to_the_migration_plan[CSV file] with the names of the source virtual machines.
. Create a new migration plan using the CSV file to add the virtual machines.

[NOTE]
====
The source virtual machines cannot be re-discovered by the migration plan because they are marked in the CloudForms database as `migrated`.
