= Recommendations for migration

The following recommendations will minimize the impact of the migration on your environment.

Checking your resources::
* Ensure that you have sufficient space for the migration. The migration process does not delete the original virtual machines.
* Plan for redundancy.

Scheduling the migration::
* Schedule your migration carefully, to minimize the impact on your users.
* Prepare your users for downtime.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Currently, IMS supports only cold migration. Virtual machines are powered off gracefully as part of the migration process.
====

* Stagger the migration schedules.
* Move critical applications during maintenance windows.

Distributing the migration workload::
* Create migration groups, so that you are not migrating all of your virtual machines at the same time, keeping in mind the following considerations:

** How are the virtual machines grouped now?
** Which virtual machines should be migrated together?
** Which workloads or linked applications should be migrated together?
** What applications must remain available?

* Consider which parts of the workload to migrate first:

** Databases
** Applications
** Web servers
** Load balancers

Deploying the conversion hosts::
* Create an appropriate number of conversion hosts. See xref:Deciding_how_many_conversion_hosts_to_create[]
* Choose the best datapath transformation option for your environment. See xref:Choosing_vddk_or_ssh_transformation[]
* OpenStack Platform:
** Deploy the conversion hosts on multiple hypervisors.
** Deploy the conversion hosts on a compute node with nested virtualization enabled (see link:https://docs.openstack.org/devstack/latest/guides/devstack-with-nested-kvm.html[]). Nested virtualization is a technology preview.

Controlling the migration process::
* Create multiple migration plans for finer control.
* Perform test migrations with different maximum numbers of concurrent migrations to assess the capabilities of your environment's infrastructure. See xref:Changing_the_maximum_number_of_concurrent_migrations[].
