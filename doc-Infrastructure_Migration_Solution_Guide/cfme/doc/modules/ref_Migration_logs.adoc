. In CloudForms, click menu:Compute[Migration Plans > Migration Plans Complete].
. Click a migration plan name to view its details.
. Click *Download Log* of a virtual machine and select a log from the dropdown list:

* *Premigration log:* This option only appears if a premigration playbook is used.
* *Migration log:* Debug log of `virt-v2v`. This log tracks the core of the virtual machine process, including `libguestfs` traces and disk migration details.
* *Virt-v2v-wrapper log:* Log of `virt-v2v-wrapper`, the daemonizing wrapper for `virt-v2v`. This log traces the orchestration of the virtual machine conversion on the conversion host, including disk migration percentages and `virt-v2v` error reporting.
* *Postmigration log:* This option only appears if a postmigration playbook is used.
