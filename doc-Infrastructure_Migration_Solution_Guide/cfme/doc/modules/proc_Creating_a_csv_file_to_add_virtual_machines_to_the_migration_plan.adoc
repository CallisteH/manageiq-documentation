= Creating a CSV file to add virtual machines to the migration plan

If you are migrating a large number of virtual machines, you can create a CSV file to add the source virtual machines to the migration plan. If you are xref:Remigrating_virtual_machines[re-migrating virtual machines], you must use a CSV file.

The virtual machine `Name` is mandatory. `Provider`, `Host`, and `Cluster` are optional, to differentiate identical virtual machine names in different environments.

.Sample CSV file with `Name` (mandatory) and `Provider` (optional)

Duplicate virtual machines with no optional fields to differentiate them, or with duplicate optional fields, are marked with a red `x` and cannot be added to the migration plan.
