After installing IMS, you must obtain critical updates for Red Hat Virtualization and the OpenStack Platform conversion appliance by doing the following:

** Red Hat Virtualization: Run `yum update`.

** OpenStack Platform: Contact link:https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/#/case/new[Red Hat Support] for a newer version of the appliance build.

These items will be addressed in a future release.
