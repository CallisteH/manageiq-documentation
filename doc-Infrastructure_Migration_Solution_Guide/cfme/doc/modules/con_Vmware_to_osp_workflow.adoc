This diagram describes the workflow of a migration to OpenStack Platform.

image:1.png[height=25] You run a xref:Running_a_migration_plan[migration plan] in CloudForms.

image:2.png[height=25] CloudForms uses the migration plan to locate the source virtual machines.

image:3.png[height=25] If you are using the VMware Virtual Disk Development Kit (VDDK) xref:datapath_transformation_options_vddk_ssh[transformation option], CloudForms captures the ESXi host fingerprint for authentication during the virtual machine conversion process.

image:4.png[height=25] Using the attributes defined for the OpenStack Platform environment, CloudForms initiates communication with the conversion hosts. (A conversion host is an OpenStack Platform instance created from a conversion host appliance, running `virt-v2v` and `virt-v2v-wrapper`.)

image:5.png[height=25] `virt-v2v-wrapper` connects to the source datastore through the ESXi host. virt-v2v streams the source disks to the target block storage, creates volumes in the block storage, attaches the volumes to the conversion host, and converts the source disks.

image:6.png[height=25] After the source disks are converted, `virt-v2v` detaches the volumes from the conversion host, migrates the volumes to the destination project, and creates the network ports defined in the infrastructure mapping.

image:7.png[height=25] `virt-v2v-wrapper` creates the target OpenStack Platform instance with the flavor and security group defined in the migration plan. `virt-v2v` attaches the newly created network ports and the disks mapped in the block storage to the instance and the instance is powered on.

The migration process is complete and the migration plan's status is displayed in CloudForms.
