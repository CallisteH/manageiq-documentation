.IMS RHEL Pre-migration Ansible Playbook Example

The link:https://galaxy.ansible.com/fdupont_redhat/ims_rhel_pre_migration[`ims.rhel_pre_migration`] role performs the following tasks to configure a target Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual machine:

* Preserving the static IP address configuration
* Installing the Red Hat Virtualization guest agent

This example registers a virtual machine with a Satellite 6 server and enables the `rhel-7-server-rpms` repository. If no variables are provided, the playbook assumes that the repositories are already configured and installs the guest agent while maintaining the static IP address.
