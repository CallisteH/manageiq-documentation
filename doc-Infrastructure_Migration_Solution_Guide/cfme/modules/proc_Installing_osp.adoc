= Installing and configuring Red Hat OpenStack Platform

You can install and configure your Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 (or later).

.Prerequisites

. Set the BIOS settings of the bare metal hosts for optimal performance, rather than power-saving, according to the vendor's recommendations.
. Disable CPU enhanced halt (C1E) in the BIOS settings, if applicable.
. Check the firewall and security group rules to ensure that the ports required for migration are open.

.Procedure

You can install and configure Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) for migration.

.Prerequisites

. Set the BIOS settings of bare metal hosts for optimal performance, rather than power-saving, according to the vendor's recommendations.
. Disable CPU enhanced halt (C1E) in the BIOS settings, if applicable.
. Check the firewall and security group rules to ensure that the ports required for migration are open.

Otherwise, CloudForms will not detect the storage when you create the infrastructure mapping.

. Ensure that the storage backends have sufficient space for the migrated virtual machines.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are using Red Hat Ceph Storage, you will require three times the space of the source virtual machines for the migrated virtual machines. A Ceph storage cluster, by default, link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ceph_storage/3/html-single/architecture_guide/index#concept-arch-data-copies-arch[creates two copies of an object in a replicated storage pool], for a total of three copies.

The migrated disks use all of the space because it is preallocated. For example, a source virtual machine with a 100 GB disk requires 300 GB of storage, regardless of how much data the disk actually contains. To save storage space, you can use the `fstrim` command on the migrated virtual machines as a postmigration task or playbook.
====

. Create flavors for the source virtual machines. If you do not create custom flavors, CloudForms will try to map each source virtual machine to an existing flavor.
