= Creating an infrastructure mapping

The infrastructure mapping maps the resources of your VMware and Red Hat environments.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you add or remove providers or provider objects from an infrastructure mapping, the mapping will have missing resource errors. You must delete the infrastructure mapping and create a new one.

.Procedure

. Click *Compute* -> *Migration* -> *Infrastructure Mappings*.
. Click *Create Infrastructure Mapping*. The *Create Infrastructure Mapping* wizard is displayed.

. In the *General* screen, enter the infrastructure mapping name and (optional) description.
. Select the *Target Provider* and click *Next*.
ifdef::rhv_1-1_vddk,rhv_1-2_vddk,rhv_1-3_vddk[]
. In the *Map Compute* screen, select a *Source Provider \ Datacenter \ Cluster* and a *Target Provider \ Datacenter \ Cluster*.
+
If the target cluster does not contain a conversion host, a warning icon (image:warning.png[height=15px]) appears. You can create and save an infrastructure mapping, but you must configure the conversion hosts before running a migration plan.

. Click *Add Mapping*. You can map additional clusters.
endif::[]
ifdef::osp_1-1_vddk,osp_1-2_vddk,osp_1-3_vddk[]
. In the *Map Compute* screen, select a *Source Provider \ Datacenter \ Cluster* source cluster and a *Target Provider \ Project*.
+
If the target project does not contain a conversion host, a warning icon (image:warning.png[height=15px]) appears. You can create and save an infrastructure mapping, but you must configure the conversion hosts before running a migration plan.

. Click *Add Mapping*. You can map additional projects.
endif::[]
. Click *Next*.

ifdef::rhv_1-1_vddk,rhv_1-2_vddk,rhv_1-3_vddk[]
. In the *Map Storage* screen, select a *Source Provider \ Datacenter \ Datastore* and *Target Datastores*.
endif::[]
ifdef::osp_1-1_vddk,osp_1-2_vddk,osp_1-3_vddk[]
. In the *Map Storage* screen, select a *Source Provider \ Datacenter \ Datastore* and *Target Provider \ Volume Type*.
+
If the volume type is missing, check that the volume type has been set. Block storage requires at least one volume type. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/16.0/html-single/storage_guide/#section-create-volume[Create a Volume] and link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/16.0/html-single/storage_guide/#section-volume-retype[Changing a Volumeâ€™s Type (Volume Re-typing)] in the _Red Hat OpenStack Platform Storage Guide_.
endif::[]

. Click *Add Mapping*. You can map additional datastores.
. Click *Next*.

. In the *Map Networks* screen, select a source cluster.
. Select one or more networks from *Source Provider \ Datacenter \ Network* and *Target Project \ Network*.
ifdef::osp_1-1_vddk,osp_1-2_vddk,osp_1-3_vddk[]
+
IMS supports both provider and tenant networks.
endif::[]

. Click *Add Mapping*. You can map the networks of additional source clusters.
. Click *Create*.
. Click *Close*. The infrastructure mapping is saved in *Compute* -> *Migration* -> *Infrastructure Mappings*.

You can click an infrastructure mapping element to view its details:
