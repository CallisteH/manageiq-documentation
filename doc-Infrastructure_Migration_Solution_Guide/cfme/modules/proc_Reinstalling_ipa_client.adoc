= Reinstalling the `ipa-client` in the Red Hat Virtualization Manager

If you are using SSH transformation and configuring your Red Hat Virtualization (RHV) conversion hosts for SSSD with single sign-on, you must reinstall the `ipa-client` in the RHV Manager without the OpenSSH client.

Otherwise, SSH fails for the vdsm user. See link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1544379[BZ#1544379: ipa-client-install changes system-wide SSH configuration] for more information.

This issue cannot be resolved by modifying the configuration file because the file is restored during upgrades.

.Procedure

. Log in to the RHV Manager machine using SSH.
. Uninstall `ipa-client`:
+
----
# ipa-client-install --uninstall
----

. Reinstall `ipa-client` without OpenSSH:
+
----
# ipa-client-install --no-ssh
----
