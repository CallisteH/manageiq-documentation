Do not complete the fields in the *RSA key pair* tab. You will add the SSH private key when you configure the conversion hosts.

. If the RHOSP provider has been active for a while, you must wait for CloudForms to update its event history before attempting to use the provider. Check the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/5.0/html-single/managing_providers/index#viewing_the_management_system_timeline[cloud provider timeline] to verify that all events have been processed.
