= Preparing the VMware network

You can prepare the VMware network for migration:

ifdef::rhv_1-1,rhv_1-2,rhv_1-3[]
* Extend the VMware network to your Red Hat Virtualization environment.
endif::[]
ifdef::osp_1-1,osp_1-2,osp_1-3[]
* Extend the VMware network to your Red Hat OpenStack Platform environment.
endif::[]
ifdef::rhv_1-3_vddk[]
* Ensure that the VMware network provides high throughput (10 GbE) and does not affect production virtual machines (for example, a backup network).
endif::[]

* Ensure that IP addresses, VLANs, and other network configuration settings are not changed before or after migration. The migration process preserves the VMware virtual machines' MAC addresses.
