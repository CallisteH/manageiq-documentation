= Creating and running a migration plan

Before attempting a large migration, you should perform several test migrations with different maximum numbers of concurrent migrations for your conversion hosts or providers. This will enable you to assess the capabilities of your environmentâ€™s infrastructure.

[NOTE]
====
A CSV file is optional, but recommended, for large migrations because it is faster than manually selecting each virtual machine.

.Procedure

. Click *Compute* -> *Migration* -> *Migration Plans*.
. Click *Create Migration Plan*. The *Create Migration Plan* wizard is displayed.
+
image:Create_Migration_Plan_screen.png[]

. In the *General* screen, select an infrastructure mapping from the drop-down list.
. Enter the migration plan *Name* and (optional) *Description*.
. Select a virtual machine discovery method:

* *Choose from a list of VMs discovered in the selected infrastructure mapping*
+
If the virtual machines cannot be discovered, check that the source datastores and networks in the infrastructure mapping are correct.

* *Import a CSV file with a list of VMs to be migrated*.
+
A CSV file is required for previously migrated source virtual machines and recommended for large migrations.

. Click *Next*.

. In the *VMs* screen, select the virtual machines for migration:

* If you selected *Choose from a list of VMs discovered in the selected infrastructure mapping*, select the virtual machines for migration.
+
You can search for virtual machines by *VM Name*, *Data Center*, *Cluster*, and *Folder*.

* If you selected *Import a CSV file with a list of VMs to be migrated*:

.. Click *Import*.
.. Browse to the CSV file and click *Open*.
+
If the virtual machines cannot be added to the migration plan, check the CSV file format and fields for errors.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the *Create Migration Plan* wizard freezes, refresh the web page, check the CSV file for errors (for example, virtual machines with duplicate `Name` fields and no other fields to distinguish them), and create a new migration plan.
====

. Click *Next*.

ifdef::osp_1-1_vddk,osp_1-2_vddk,osp_1-3_vddk[]
. In the *Instance Properties* screen, click the pencil icon to edit the network or flavor of each selected virtual machine.
+
Flavors that are too small for the virtual machine are marked with an asterisk (`*`). If you have not created flavors for the migration, CloudForms tries to map the source virtual machines to existing flavors.

. Click *Next*.
endif::osp_1-1_vddk,osp_1-2_vddk,osp_1-3_vddk[]

. In the *Advanced Options* screen, select the playbook service options:

.. Select a premigration and/or postmigration playbook service from the dropdown lists.
.. Select the virtual machines on which to run the playbook services.

. Click *Next*.

. In the *Schedule* screen, select a schedule option and click *Create*:

* *Save migration plan to run later*
+
The migration plan is saved in *Migration Plans Not Started* and will not run unless you xref:Scheduling_a_saved_migration_plan_{context}[schedule] it or click *Migrate* to run the scheduled migration plan immediately.

* *Start migration immediately*
+
The migration plan may take some time to complete. Progress bars indicate the amount of transferred data, the number of migrated virtual machines, and the elapsed time. You can xref:Canceling_a_migration_plan_{context}[cancel a migration plan in progress].

.. To view the progress of a migration plan, Click *Migration Plans in Progress*.
.. Click a migration plan name to view its details, including the status of the migrating virtual machines.
+
[NOTE]
====
The Migration Plans time counter displays the total time for running the migration plan. The Migration Plan Details time counter displays the time for migrating the virtual machines.

If the server and client clocks are not synchronized, a discrepancy between the migration time counters will appear.
====

. In the *Results* screen, click *Close*.
+
When the migration plan has finished, click *Migration Plans Complete* to view the status of the migration plan. The completed migration plan shows the status of the migrated virtual machines.

In the migration plans list, you can click the *More Actions* icon (image:More_actions_icon.png[7]) to archive, edit, or delete a migration plan.

If a migration fails because of external circumstances (for example, power outage), you can xref:Retrying_a_failed_migration_plan_{context}[retry the migration plan].

[id="Scheduling_a_saved_migration_plan_{context}"]
== Scheduling a saved migration plan

To schedule a saved migration plan to run in the future:

. Click *Migration Plans Not Started*.
. Click the *Schedule* button of a migration plan.
. In the *Schedule Migration Plan* window, select a date and time and click *Schedule*.
+
The plan's status is *Migration Scheduled* with the date and time.

[id="Canceling_a_migration_plan_{context}"]
== Canceling a migration plan in progress

To cancel a migration plan in progress:

. Click *Migration Plans in Progress*.
. Select a migration plan and click *Cancel Migration*.
. Click *Cancel Migrations* to confirm the cancellation.
+
The canceled migration appears in *Migration Plans Complete* with a red `x` indicating that the plan did not complete successfully.

[id="Retrying_a_failed_migration_plan_{context}"]
== Retrying a failed migration plan

To retry a migration plan that failed because of external circumstances (for example, power outage):

. Delete all objects created by the failed migration plan:
ifdef::rhv_1-1_vddk,rhv_1-2_vddk,rhv_1-3_vddk[]
* Delete newly created virtual machines to avoid name conflicts with migrating VMware virtual machines.
* Delete converted disks to free up space.
endif::rhv_1-1_vddk,rhv_1-2_vddk,rhv_1-3_vddk[]
ifdef::osp_1-1_vddk,osp_1-2_vddk,osp_1-3_vddk[]
* Delete newly created instances to avoid name conflicts with migrating VMware virtual machines.
* Delete network ports of failed instances.
endif::osp_1-1_vddk,osp_1-2_vddk,osp_1-3_vddk[]
. Click *Compute* -> *Migration* -> *Migration Plans*.
. Click *Migration Plans Complete*.
. Click the *Retry* button beside the failed migration plan.
