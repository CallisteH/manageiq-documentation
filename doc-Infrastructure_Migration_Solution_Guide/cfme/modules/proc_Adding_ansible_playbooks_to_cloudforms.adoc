= Adding Ansible playbooks to CloudForms for premigration and postmigration tasks

You can add Ansible playbooks to CloudForms to perform automated premigration and postmigration tasks on specific virtual machines, for example:

* Removing web servers from a load-balancing pool before migration and returning them to the pool after migration
* Preserving the IP addresses of VMware virtual machines running RHEL or other Linux operating system
ifdef::osp_1-1_vddk,osp_1-2_vddk,osp_1-3_vddk[]
* Running `fstrim` after migration to reduce the space required by virtual machines migrating to Red Hat OpenStack Platform  with Ceph storage
endif::[]
