.Red Hat Virtualization (RHV)

* Name conflict
+
VMware virtual machine has the same name as a RHV virtual machine.

* MAC address conflict
+
VMware virtual machine has the same MAC address as a RHV virtual machine in a MAC address pool.

* Check that the RHV conversion host does not have an existing private SSH key in `/var/lib/vdsm/.ssh/id_rsa`. Conversion host configuration does not overwrite old SSH keys. They must be deleted manually.

* SSH transformation only:

** If you are using SSSD with single sign-on, you must reinstall `ipa-client` without OpenSSH.
** Check that you enabled SSH access on the VMware hypervisors and correctly configured your conversion hosts for SSH transformation.
