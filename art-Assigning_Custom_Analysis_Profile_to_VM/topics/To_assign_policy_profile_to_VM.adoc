== Assigning the Policy Profile to a Virtual Machine

Assign the policy profile you created in xref:create-policy-profile-assign-vm-control-policy[] to a virtual machine, and initiate SmartState analysis. 

[NOTE]
====
Policy profiles can be specified at multiple levels. That is, if you assign this to a provider (Amazon EC2 or OpenStack for example), the policy profile will apply to all hosts or virtual machines for that provider.
