[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title_short} performs SmartState analysis on container providers by creating an OpenShift pod to run the SmartState process. When using a proxy to connect to outside resources, such as the image repository used by OpenShift, add the proxy credentials to the OpenShift pod as described in https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2915411.
