When enabling metrics on OpenShift Container Platform, you can store your metrics data on _persistent_ or _non-persistent_ storage. To use persistent storage, you need to provision a persistent volume specifically for this purpose before xref:ocp-metrics-storage[configuring the metrics components]. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.9/html/architecture/additional-concepts#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[Persistent Volumes] in the OpenShift Container Platform _Architecture_ documentation for more information.
