== Configuring Image Scanning

{product-title} manages vulnerability scanning of container images. When an OpenShift provider is added, OpenShift images from the internal registry are discovered. To enable image scanning, perform the following configuration steps:

. Navigate to menu:Compute[Containers > Providers].
. Select the checkboxes of the OpenShift providers on which to enable scanning.
. From the *Policy* pull-down menu, click *Manage Policies*.
. Select the *OpenSCAP profile* checkbox.
. Click *Save*.

This action will trigger a SmartState analysis, or scan, of all images referenced by the OpenShift provider. The initial scan may take several hours to complete, depending on the number and size of images. OpenShift limits the number of scanning pods. Only three images can be scanned simultaneously.

== Scheduling A Recurring Scan

Software vulnerability databases are updated frequently. To apply these updates, a rescan is required. To schedule a recurring scan of container images:

. From the settings menu, select *Configuration*.
. From menu:Settings[Zones] in the left pane of the appliance, select *Schedules*.
. From the drop-down menu, click menu:Configuration[Add a new Schedule].
. Type an arbitrary *Name*.
. Type an arbitrary *Description*.
. Ensure the *Active* checkbox is selected.
. In *Action*, select *Container Image Analysis*.
. In *Filter*, select *All Container Images for Containers Provider*, *OpenShift*.
. In *Run*, set the schedule as desired.
. Set the *Time Zone*, *Starting Date*, and *Starting Time*.
. Click *Add*.

== Working with Images

=== Viewing Results

Image scanning results are displayed in each image summary page.

. Select menu:Compute[Containers > Container Images].
. Click the desired image.

For an OpenSCAP HTML report, locate the *Configuration* section and select *OpenSCAP HTML*.

For compliance and scanning history information, locate the *Compliance* section and note the *Status* field or select *Available* from the *History* field.

=== Manual Scanning

SmartState analysis scanning may be initiated manually for images. From an image summary page, select menu:Configuration[Perform SmartState Analysis]. Refreshing the image page will reflect the latest scan results and compliance history.

=== Evaluating Compliance

If the image scan policy has been updated since the last scan, compliance conditions may be re-evaluated. From an image summary page, select menu:Policy[Check Compliance of Last Known Configuration]. Refreshing the image page will reflect the latest compliance history.

=== Generating a Report on Images

You can output the results of an OpenSCAP scan of images to a report, so that you can flag the high-security risk images to be scanned (and not scan the safe ones).

To create a report:
// From _to_generate_a_single_report in monitoring, Alerts and reporting, but modified.

. Navigate to menu:Cloud Intelligence[Reports].
. Click the menu:Reports[All Reports] accordion. Navigate to menu:Configuration Management[Containers > Images by Failed OpenSCAP Rule Results] for a report showing which images have failed the OpenSCAP compliance.
. Click  image:1847.png[] (*Queue*).
. The report generation is placed on the queue and its status shows in the reports page.

. Click  image:2106.png[] *(Reload current display)* to update the status. NEEDS NEW ICON FOR RELOAD.
. Navigate to the *Saved Reports* accordion, and click the report when it is completed.
. Click ??Download as CSV (or text?), sort the reports by Severity
.

== OpenSCAP Policy Profile

{product-title} is pre-configured with a default scanning policy profile. This includes conditions to scan and identify compliance, as well as annotate compliance failure. SmartState analysis is performed when new images are added to OpenShift.

=== Customizing the Scanning Policy Profile

The default OpenSCAP policy profile cannot be edited. To customize scanning policy, copy the default profile as a starting point and edit.

. Navigate to menu:Control[Explorer].
. Select menu:Policy Profiles[All Policy Profiles > OpenSCAP Profile].
. Select menu:Configuration[Copy this Policy Profile].

The copied profile can be edited as required. Be sure to assign the customized profile to the OpenShift provider.

== Controlling OpenShift Pod Execution

Through the default policy profile, non-compliant images receive the control policy action *Mark as Non-Compliant*. This action annotates the *image* object (not to be confused with the *imagestream* object) with _images.openshift.io/deny-execution=true_. This annotation may be used to prevent nodes from running non-compliant images.
