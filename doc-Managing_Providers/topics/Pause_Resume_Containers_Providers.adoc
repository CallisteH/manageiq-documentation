= Pausing / Resuming Containers Providers

{product-title_short} has the ability to pause and resume containers providers. This allows users to add a number of potentially resource-intensive providers, then pause and resume those that are not required at a given time. Besides, in case of any maintainance of the provider, users may want to pause a provider to ensure {product-title_short} does not try to connect to collect data and generate log errors or collect partial data.

[NOTE]
====
* While the provider is paused no data will be collected from it. This may cause gaps in inventory, metrics and events. 

* Also, the provider itself is not turned off when paused, but only temporarily disables the link between {product-title_short} and the provider. Resuming the provider re-enables the link between {product-title_short} and the provider.
