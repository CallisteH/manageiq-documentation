= Pausing and Resuming Containers Providers

{product-title_short} has the ability to pause and resume containers providers. This allows users to add a number of potentially resource-intensive providers, then pause and resume those that are not required at a given time. Besides, in the case of some scheduled maintainance of the provider, users may want to pause a provider to ensure {product-title_short} does not try to connect to collect data and generate log errors or collect partial data.

[WARNING]
====
While the provider is paused no data will be collected from it. This may cause gaps in inventory, metrics and events.
