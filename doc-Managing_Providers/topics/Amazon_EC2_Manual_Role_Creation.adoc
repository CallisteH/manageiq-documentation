To eliminate the need to assign _Admin_ group privileges to the Amazon EC2 provider, create an IAM role following the procedure described in link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html[Creating a Role for an AWS Service (Console)] in the Amazon Web Services documentation. 

Use the following parameters:

. Select *EC2* as the service the role will use.
. Attach the following permissions:
.. `AmazonEC2FullAccess`
.. `AmazonS3FullAccess`
.. `AmazonSQSFullAccess`
. Enter `smartstate` for the *Role name*. 

Once the IAM role is created, assign the provider _Power User_ privileges as described in xref:amazon-provider-permissions[].
