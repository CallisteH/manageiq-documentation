= Scanning the virtual machines

You can scan your VMware virtual machines in Red Hat CloudForms.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Some virtual machines should not be analyzed because the snapshot process may cause data corruption.

For more information, navigate to the link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/index.html[VMware vSphere Documentation] for your vSphere version. Expand *ESXi and vCenter Server* -> *vSphere Virtual Machine Administration* -> *Managing Virtual Machines* -> *Using Snapshots To Manage Virtual Machines* and select *Snapshot Limitations*.

You can exclude a virtual machine from the scan by assigning to it the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/5.0/html-single/managing_infrastructure_and_inventory/index#to_tag_virtual_machines_and_templates[`exclusions` tag, with the `do_not_analyze` value].

.Prerequisites

* SmartState analysis and SmartProxy must be enabled.
* You must have a valid VM analysis profile called `default`. If you create an analysis profile with a different name, you must link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/5.0/html-single/assigning_a_custom_analysis_profile_to_a_virtual_machine/index#create-vm-control-policy[create a control policy] and assign it to the vSphere provider.
