= Creating a `default` SmartState analysis profile

You can create a `default` SmartState analysis profile for Migration Analytics by copying the `Sample` analysis profile provided in CloudForms.

[NOTE]
====
If you create an analysis profile with a name other than `default`, you must link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/5.0/html-single/assigning_a_custom_analysis_profile_to_a_virtual_machine/index#create-vm-control-policy[create a control policy] and assign it to the vSphere provider.

If a `default` analysis profile does not exist or if you have not created a control policy to assign a different analysis profile, no profile is used for the scan.
