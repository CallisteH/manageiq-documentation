= Combining multiple inventory files

You can combine multiple inventory files, for example, from different data centers, into a single file in order to generate a single Migration Analytics report.

.Prerequisites

* You must ensure that the inventory files do not contain duplicate information.

.Procedure

. Log in to the CloudForms machine.
. Create a common directory for the extracted inventory files:
+
----
# mkdir extracted_files
----

. Extract an inventory file to the common directory:
+
----
# tar -xvf <inventory_file_name>.tar.gz -C extracted_files/ <1>
----
<1> Specify the inventory file name.

. Rename the extracted JSON inventory file. Each file name must be unique.

. Create a new archive file containing the extracted inventory files:
+
----
# tar -czvf <new_archive>.tar.gz extracted_files/ <1>
----
<1> Specify the new archive file name.

You can browse to the new archive file when you create a Migration Analytics report.
