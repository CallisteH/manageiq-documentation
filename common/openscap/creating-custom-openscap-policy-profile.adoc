The built-in OpenSCAP policy profile cannot be edited. You can, however, assign _edited_ copies of its policies to a new policy profile. This will allow you to create a _customized_ version of the built-in OpenSCAP policy profile.

To do so, you will first have to copy the policy you want to customize:

. Navigate to menu:Control[Explorer].
. Click the *Policies* accordion, and select the policy you want to copy.
. Click image:../images/1847.png[image](*Configuration*), and an option to copy the policy should appear; for example, image:../images/1859.png[image] (*Copy this Image Policy*).
+
image:../images/1860.png[image]
. Click *OK* to confirm.

The new policy is created with a prefix of *Copy of* in its description, and it can be viewed in the Policy accordion.

You can now edit the copied policy. For instructions on how to edit policies, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.6/html-single/policies_and_profiles_guide[Policies and Profiles] guide.

After editing copied policies, you can add them to a new policy profile. For instructions on how to create a new policy profile (and add policies to it), see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.6/html-single/policies_and_profiles_guide/#profiles-create[Creating Policy Profiles]. 

Once you have a customized policy profile, you can assign it to a container provider. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.6/html-single/policies_and_profiles_guide/#profile-assign[Assigning Policy Profiles] for instructions.
