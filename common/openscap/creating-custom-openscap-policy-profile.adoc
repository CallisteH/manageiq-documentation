The built-in OpenSCAP policy profile cannot be edited. You can, however, assign _edited_ copies of its policies to a new policy profile. This will allow you to create a customized version of the built-in OpenSCAP policy profile.

To do so, you will first have to copy the policy you want to customize:

. Navigate to menu:Control[Explorer].
. Click the *Policies* accordion, and select *Container Image Compliance Policies*, then click *OpenSCAP*.
. Click image:../images/1847.png[image](*Configuration*), and an option to copy the policy should appear; for example, image:../images/1859.png[image] (*Copy this Container Image Policy*).
. Click *OK* to confirm.

The new policy is created with a prefix of *Copy of* in its description, and it can be viewed in the Policies accordion.

You can now edit the copied policy. After editing copied policies, you can add them to a new policy profile. For instructions on how to edit policies, create a new policy profile, and add policies to it, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/html-single/policies_and_profiles_guide[Policies and Profiles] guide. Once you have a customized policy profile, you can assign it to a containers provider.
