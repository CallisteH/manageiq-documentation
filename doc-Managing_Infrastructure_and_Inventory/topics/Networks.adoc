== Creating and Administering Cloud Networks

Create a network to give your instances a place to communicate with each other and receive IP addresses using DHCP. A network can also be integrated with external networks in your Red Hat OpenStack Platform deployment or elsewhere, such as the physical network. This integration allows your instances to communicate with outside systems. For more information, see Bridge the physical network.

When creating networks, it is important to know that networks can host multiple subnets. This is useful if you intend to host distinctly different systems in the same network, and would prefer a measure of isolation between them. For example, you can designate that only webserver traffic is present on one subnet, while database traffic traverse another. Subnets are isolated from each other, and any instance that wishes to communicate with another subnet must have their traffic directed by a router. Consider placing systems that will require a high volume of traffic amongst themselves in the same subnet, so that they donâ€™t require routing, and avoid the subsequent latency and load.
