=== Adding an Interface to a Network Router  

Interfaces allow you to interconnect routers with subnets. As a result, the router can direct any traffic that instances send to destinations outside of their intermediate subnet.

To add an interface to a network router:

. Navigate to menu:Networks[Network Routers].
. Select a network router from the list view. 
. Click  image:1847.png[Configuration] (*Configuration*), then  image:1851.png[Add Interface to this Router] (*Add Interface to this Router*).
. Select a *Subnet* from the list. 
. Click *Add*.
