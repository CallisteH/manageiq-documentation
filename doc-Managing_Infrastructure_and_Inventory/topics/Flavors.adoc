= Flavors

Flavors indicate the resource profiles available for instances.
Each flavor contains a value set for CPUs, CPU cores and memory. Flavors allow you to pre-configure resource settings, which you can then apply during instance provisioning. You can also change the flavor of a provisioned instance; see xref:_to_resize_an_instance_via_flavor[] for instructions.

{product-title} provides the ability to view individual flavor information and instances currently using the flavor.
