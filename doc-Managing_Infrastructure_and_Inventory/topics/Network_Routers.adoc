== Configuring Network Routers

{product-title} enables configuration for Red Hat OpenStack Platform provider cloud network routing services using an SDN-based virtual router. Routers are a requirement for your instances to communicate with external subnets, including those out in the physical network. Routers and subnets connect using interfaces, with each subnet requiring its own interface to the router. A routerâ€™s default gateway defines the next hop for any traffic received by the router. Its network is typically configured to route traffic to the external physical network using a virtual bridge.
