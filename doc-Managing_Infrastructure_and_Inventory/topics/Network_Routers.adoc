== Configuring Network Routers

{product-title} enables configuration for Red Hat OpenStack Platform provider cloud network routing services using an SDN-based virtual router.

* Routers are a requirement for your instances to communicate with external subnets, including those out in the physical network. 
* Routers and subnets connect using interfaces, with each subnet requiring its own interface to the router. 
* A router's default gateway defines the next hop for any traffic received by the router. 
* A router's network is typically configured to route traffic to the external physical network using a virtual bridge.
