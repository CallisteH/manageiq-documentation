. Click image:1847.png(Configuration) and click *Add a new Cloud Subnet*.
. Select a *Network Manager*.
. Under *Placement*, select a *Cloud Tenant*. 
. Provide the following *Cloud Subnet* details:
.. A descriptive *Subnet Name*. 
.. The *Gateway* IP address of the router interface for the default gateway. 
.. *Enable DHCP* services for the subnet. DHCP allows automated distribution of IP settings to instances.

.. Input the *Subnet CIDR* address in CIDR format, which contains the IP address range and subnet mask in one value.

[NOTE]
====
Determine the address by calculating the number of bits masked in the subnet mask and append that value to the IP address range. For example, the subnet mask 255.255.255.0 has 24 masked bits. To use this mask with the IPv4 address range 192.168.122.0, specify the address 192.168.122.0/24.
