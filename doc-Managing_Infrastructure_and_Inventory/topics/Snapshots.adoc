= Managing Virtual Machine Snapshots (Red Hat Virtualization Virtual Machines Only)

A snapshot is a view of a virtual machine's operating system and applications on any or all available disks at a given point in time. Take a snapshot of a virtual machine before you make a change to it that may have unintended consequences. You can use a snapshot to return a virtual machine to a previous state.

The procedures in this section apply to Red Hat Virtualization virtual machines only. View virtual machines by infrastructure providers by navigating to menu:Compute[Infrastructure > Providers].
