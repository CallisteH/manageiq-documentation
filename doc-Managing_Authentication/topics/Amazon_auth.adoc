= Configuring AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Authentication

If you choose Amazon AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) as your authentication mode, required parameters are exposed under *Amazon Primary AWS Account Settings for IAM* (Identity and Access Management). Be sure to validate your settings before saving them.

[NOTE]
====
For further information on AWS Identity and Access Management settings, see the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html[AWS documentation].

To configure {product-title_short} to use AWS IAM authentication:

. From the settings menu, select *Configuration*. 
. Select your server in the *Settings* accordion.
. Select the *Authentication* tab.
. Use *Session Timeout* to set the period of inactivity before a user is logged out of the console.
. Select *Amazon* as the authentication method in the *Mode* list. 
. Type in an *Access Key* provided by your Amazon account.
. Type in a *Secret Key* provided by your Amazon account.
. Optionally, select *Get User Groups from Amazon* to retrieve the user's group membership from Amazon. This is used for mapping a user's authorization to a {product-title_short} role. 
. Click *Validate* to verify your settings.
. Click *Save*.
////
*From LDAP section - check if it applies to Amazon.*
This requires group names on the LDAP server to match {product-title_short} group names.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do not check *Get User Groups from LDAP*, the user must be defined in the VMDB using the console where the User ID is the same as the user's name in your directory service typed in lowercase.

Users logging into {product-title_short} with Amazon authentication enter their own IAM access key as the username and IAM secret access key as the password.

Amazon users must be added as a {product-title_short} user or belong to an IAM user group added to the list of {product-title_short} groups.
