= Configuring Authentication with Active Directory
//source content https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2751431

This procedure outlines how to configure {product-title_short} to authenticate against an existing Active Directory (AD) configuration using external HTTP authentication. This provides Active Directory users access to the {product-title_short} appliance user interface, as well as the REST API.


// EDIT A SUMMARY FOR THIS To enable external authentication using Active Directory complete the following steps to configure your HTTP server, then your {product-title_short} appliance.

// Do we need Network Manager step from MIQ docs still?)

. Connect to the {product-title_short} appliance using SSH.
. Run `realm discover` to determine what Active Directory realms are available:
+
----
# realm discover
example.com
  type: kerberos
  realm-name: EXAMPLE.COM
  domain-name: example.com
  configured: kerberos-member
  server-software: active-directory
  client-software: sssd
  required-package: oddjob
  required-package: oddjob-mkhomedir
  required-package: sssd
  required-package: adcli
  required-package: samba-common
  login-formats: %U@example.com
  login-policy: allow-realm-logins
----
+
. Using the above information for your realm, join the Active Directory realm with a user that has enough permissions to be able to browse the directory:
+
----
# realm join example.com -U user
Password for user: ******
----
+
. Allow all realm users to log in using `realm permit`:
+
----
# realm permit --all
----
+
. Edit the `/etc/sssd/sssd.conf` file with your Active Directory domain details. Refer to the following example for formatting:
//certain lines have arrows upstream. highlight these for replacing values?
+
----
[domain/example.com]
  ad_domain = example.com
  krb5_realm = EXAMPLE.COM
  realmd_tags = manages-system joined-with-samba
  cache_credentials = True
  id_provider = ad
  krb5_store_password_if_offline = True
  default_shell = /bin/bash
  ldap_id_mapping = True
  use_fully_qualified_names = True
  fallback_homedir = /home/%d/%u
  access_provider = ad
 ldap_user_extra_attrs = mail, givenname, sn, displayname, domainname

[sssd]
domains = example.com
config_file_version = 2
services = nss, pam, ifp
default_domain_suffix = example.com

[nss]
homedir_substring = /home

[pam]
default_domain_suffix = example.com

[ifp]
default_domain_suffix = example.com
allowed_uids = apache, root
user_attributes = +mail, +givenname, +sn, +displayname, +domainname
----
+
. Restart and enable the `sssd` service:
+
----
# systemctl restart sssd
# systemctl enable sssd
----
+
//Do we need the upstream step for chgrp apache? Added just in case
. Make sure the Kerberos keytab created by `realm join` above is readable by Apache:
+
----
# chgrp apache /etc/krb5.keytab
# chmod 640 /etc/krb5.keytab
----
+
. Copy the following `httpd` configuration files into the correct respective directories with the following commands:
+
----
# TEMPLATE_DIR="/opt/rh/cfme-appliance/TEMPLATE"
# cp ${TEMPLATE_DIR}/etc/pam.d/httpd-auth /etc/pam.d/httpd-auth
# cp ${TEMPLATE_DIR}/etc/httpd/conf.d/manageiq-remote-user.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/
# cp ${TEMPLATE_DIR}/etc/httpd/conf.d/manageiq-external-auth.conf.erb /etc/httpd/conf.d/manageiq-external-auth.conf
----
+
. Edit the `/etc/httpd/conf.d/manageiq-external-auth.conf` file to point to your Kerberos domain hosted by your Active Directory domain by adding the lines for `KrbAuthRealms`, `Krb5KeyTab` and `KrbServiceName` for your environment:
// do we edit only the lines that say "add line?"
+
----
<Location /dashboard/kerberos_authenticate>
  AuthType           Kerberos
  AuthName           "Kerberos Login"
  KrbMethodNegotiate On
  KrbMethodK5Passwd  Off
  KrbAuthRealms      example.com     
  Krb5KeyTab         /etc/krb5.keytab 
  KrbServiceName     Any                   
  Require            pam-account httpd-auth

  ErrorDocument 401  /proxy_pages/invalid_sso_credentials.js
</Location>
----
+
. Set the appropriate SELinux booleans:
+
----
# setsebool -P allow_httpd_mod_auth_pam on
# setsebool -P httpd_dbus_sssd          on
----
+
. Restart and enable the `httpd` service:
+
----
# systemctl restart httpd
# systemctl enable httpd
----

Complete authentication setup by configuring the following on each appliance with the `user_interface` or `web_services` server roles enabled. Follow these steps from the {product-title_short} user interface:

. Log in to the user interface as an administrative user.
. Navigate to the settings menu, then menu:Configuration[Authentication].
. Select a *Session Timeout* if required.
. Select *External (httpd)* as the authentication *Mode*.
. Select *Enable Single Sign-On* to allow single sign-on using Kerberos tickets from client machines that authenticate to the same Active Directory domain as the appliance.
. In the *Role Settings* area, select *Get User Groups from External Authentication (httpd)*.
. Click *Save*.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure the user's Active Directory group for the appliance are created and appropriate roles assigned to those groups. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.6/html-single/general_configuration/#roles[Roles] in _General Configuration_ for more information.
====

{product-title_short} is now configured to use authentication from your Active Directory domain.
