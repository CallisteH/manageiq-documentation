== Installing the Appliances

This chapter outlines the steps for installing and configuring the {product-title} components needed for high availability: a database cluster comprised of primary and standby database-only appliances, and two (at minimum) {product-title_short} appliances.

[[installation_primary_db]]
=== Installing the Primary Database-Only Appliance

The primary database-only appliance functions as an external database to the {product-title_short} appliances. This procedure creates the database.

<<<<<<< HEAD
. Deploy a {product-title_short} appliance with an extra partition for the database at a size appropriate for your deployment. For recommendations on disk space, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.6/html/deployment_planning_guide/introduction#database-requirements[Database Requirements] in the _Deployment Planning Guide_.

. Configure time synchronization on the appliance by editing `/etc/chronyd.conf` with valid NTP server information.
. SSH into the {product-title_short} appliance to enter the appliance console. 
. Configure networking as desired by selecting the *Set DHCP Network Configuration* or *Set Static Network Configuration* option.
. Re-synchronize time information across the appliances:
+
------
# systemctl enable chronyd.service
# systemctl start chronyd.service
------
+
. In the appliance console, configure the hostname by selecting *Set Hostname*.
. Select *Configure Database*.
. Select *Create key* to create the encryption key. You can create a new key, or use an existing key on your system by selecting *Fetch key from remote machine* and following the prompts.
. Select *Create Internal Database*.
. Select the database disk. {product-title_short} then activates the configuration.
. For *Should this appliance run as a standalone database server?*, select `y`. Selecting this option configures this appliance as a database-only appliance, and therefore the {product-title_abbr_uc} application and `evmserverd` processes will not run. This is required in highly available database deployments.
+
[WARNING]
====
This configuration is not reversible.
====
+
. Create the database password.

[NOTE]
====
Do not create a region at this stage in the procedure.
====

You have now created the empty database. 

To check the configuration on the appliance console details screen. If configured successfully, *Local Database Server* shows as `running (primary)`. 

Running the `psql` command also provides information about the database.


[[installation_appliance]]
=== Installing the First {product-title_short} Appliance

Install and configure a {product-title_short} appliance to point to the primary database server. You can then create a database region and configure the primary database. This appliance does not serve as a database server. 

After installing and configuring an empty database-only appliance in xref:installation_primary_db[], the steps in this section create the database schema used by {product-title_short} on the primary database-only appliance, and populate the database with the initial data.  

[IMPORTANT]
====
Region metadata is required to configure the primary database-only appliance as a primary node in the replication cluster. This must be configured from the {product-title_short} appliance before the primary and secondary database-only appliances can be configured.
====

. Deploy a {product-title_short} appliance. There is no requirement for an extra partition on this appliance.
. Configure time synchronization on the appliance by editing `/etc/chronyd.conf` with valid NTP server information.
. SSH into the {product-title_short} appliance to enter the appliance console. 
. Configure networking as desired by selecting the *Set DHCP Network Configuration* or *Set Static Network Configuration* option.
. Re-synchronize time information across the appliances:
+
------
# systemctl enable chronyd.service
# systemctl start chronyd.service
------
+
<<<<<<< HEAD

This initializes the database, which takes a few minutes.

You can check the configuration on the appliance console details screen. When configured successfully, *{product-title_abbr_uc} Server* will show as `running`, and *{product-title_abbr_uc} Database* will show the hostname of the primary database-only appliance.


[[configuring_primary_db]]
=== Configuring the Primary Database-Only Appliance

<<<<<<< HEAD
On the primary database-only appliance, initialize the nodes in the database cluster to configure the database replication:
=======
On the primary database-only appliance you created in xref:installation_primary_db[], initialize the nodes in the database cluster to configure the database replication. Run these steps from the appliance console:
>>>>>>> 02dc81d3... edits throughout installation and config procedures from testing with consulting

. In the appliance console menu, select *Configure Database Replication*. 
. Select *Configure Server as Primary*.
. Set a unique identifier number for the server and enter the database name and credentials:
.. Select a number to uniquely identify the node in the replication cluster.
.. Enter the name of the database you configured previously.
.. Enter the cluster database username.
.. Enter the cluster database password and confirm the password.
.. Enter the primary database-only appliance hostname or IP address.
+
[NOTE]
====
The hostname must be visible to all appliances that communicate with this database, including the {product-title_short} appliances and any global region databases.
====
+
.. Confirm that the replication server configuration details are correct, and select `y` to apply the configuration.

This configures database replication in the cluster.


[[installation_standby_db]]
=== Installing the Standby Database-Only Appliance

The standby database-only appliance is a copy of the primary database-only appliance and takes over the role of primary database in case of failure.

. Deploy a {product-title_short} appliance with an extra partition for the database that is the same size as the primary database-only appliance, as it will contain the same data. For recommendations on disk space, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.6/html/deployment_planning_guide/introduction#database-requirements[Database Requirements] in the _Deployment Planning Guide_.
. Configure time synchronization on the appliance by editing `/etc/chronyd.conf` with valid NTP server information.
. SSH into the {product-title_short} appliance to enter the appliance console. 
. Configure networking as desired by selecting the *Set DHCP Network Configuration* or *Set Static Network Configuration* option.
. Re-synchronize time information across the appliances:
+
------
# systemctl enable chronyd.service
# systemctl start chronyd.service
------
+
. In the appliance console, configure the hostname by selecting *Set Hostname*.

You can now configure this appliance as a standby database-only appliance in the cluster.


[[configuring_standby_db]]
=== Configuring the Standby Database-Only Appliance

The steps to configure the standby database-only appliance are similar to that of the primary database-only appliance, in that they prepare the appliance to be database-only, but as the standby.

On the standby database-only appliance, configure the following:

. In the appliance console menu, select *Configure Database Replication*. 
. Select *Configure Server as Standby*.
. Select the database disk. {product-title_short} then activates the configuration.
. Set a unique identifier number for the standby server and enter the database name and credentials:
.. Select a number to uniquely identify the node in the replication cluster.
.. Enter the cluster database name.
.. Enter the cluster database username.
.. Enter and confirm the cluster database password.
.. Enter the primary database-only appliance hostname or IP address.
.. Enter the standby database-only appliance hostname or IP address.
+
[NOTE]
====
The hostname must be visible to all appliances that communicate with this database, including the engine appliances and any global region databases.
====
+
.. Select `y` to configure the replication manager for automatic failover.
.. Confirm that the replication standby server configuration details are correct, and select `y` to apply the configuration.

The standby server will then run an initial synchronization with the primary database, and start locally in standby mode. This takes a few minutes.

Verify the configuration on the appliance console details screen for the standby server. When configured successfully, *Local Database Server* shows as `running (standby)`.
