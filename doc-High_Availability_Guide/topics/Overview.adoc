[[Overview]]
== Environment Overview

This guide describes how to configure and manage database high availability in a {product-title} environment. This configuration allows for disaster mitigation: a failure in the primary database does not result in downtime, as the standby database takes over the failed databaseâ€™s processes. This is made possible by database replication between two or more database servers. In {product-title_short}, these servers are _database-only {product-title_short} appliances_ which do not have `evmserverd` processes enabled. This is configured from the `appliance_console` menu at the time of deployment. 

This guide describes two types of appliances used in high availability: 

* _Database-only {product-title_short} appliances_, which do not have `evmserverd` processes enabled or a user interface.
* _{product-title_short} appliances_, which are standard appliances containing a user interface and which have `evmserverd` processes enabled.

Unlike the high availability method in older versions of CloudForms which uses `pacemaker`, the built-in database high availability in CloudForms 4.2 and newer is achieved by `repmgr` database replication with PostgreSQL.

Unlike the high availability method in older versions of ManageIQ which uses pacemaker, the built-in database high availability in this version of ManageIQ is achieved by `repmgr` database replication with PostgreSQL.

In this configuration, a failover monitor daemon is configured and running on each {product-title_short} (non-database) appliance. The failover monitor watches the `repmgr` metadata about the database-only appliances present in the cluster. When the primary database-only appliance goes down, the {product-title_short} appliances start polling each of the configured standby database-only appliances to monitor which one comes up as the new primary. The promotion is orchestrated either by `repmgrd` on the database-only appliances or is done manually. When the {product-title_short} appliances find that a standby has been promoted, {product-title_short} reconfigures the setup by writing the new IP address in the `database.yml` file to point to the new primary. 

[NOTE]
====
Manual steps are required to reintroduce the failed database node back as the standby server. See xref:reintroducing_the_failed_node[].
====

Note, this procedure also does not provide scalability or a multi-master database setup. While a {product-title_short} environment is comprised of an engine tier and a database tier, this configuration affects only the database tier and does not provide load balancing for the appliances. 

[[requirements]]
=== Requirements

For a high availability {product-title} environment, you need a virtualization host containing at minimum four virtual machines with {product-title_short} installed, consisting of:

- One virtual machine for the primary external database containing a minimum of 4GB dedicated disk space
- One virtual machine for the standby external database containing a minimum of 4GB dedicated disk space
- Two virtual machines for the {product-title_short} appliances

ifdef::cfme[]
See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.6/html/deployment_planning_guide/planning[Planning] in the _Deployment Planning Guide_ for information on setting up the correct disk space for the database-only appliances.
endif::cfme[]

The database-only appliances should reside on a highly reliable local network in the same location.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is essential to use the same {product-title} appliance template version to install each virtual machine in this environment. 

ifdef::cfme[]
See the https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-cloudforms[Red Hat Customer Portal] to obtain the appliance download for the platform you are running {product-title_short} on.
endif::cfme[]
====

Correct time synchronization is required before installing the cluster. After installing the appliances, configure time synchronization on all appliances using `chronyd`.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat recommends using a DNS server for a high availability configuration, as DNS names can be updated more quickly than IP addresses when restoring an operation in a different location, network, or datacenter.
