== Scaling a Highly Available {product-title_short} Environment

After creating high availability for the database tier and the user interface tier, the rest of the infrastructure should be sized appropriately for the roles and the environments that they manage. These roles and tiers use built-in high availability mechanisms like primary, secondary, and tertiary failover.

You can configure additional worker appliances as needed using the steps in xref:installation_appliances_addl[], and then assign zones and server roles. The {product-title_short} appliances and roles can be configured in any order.

/////
.Considerations

* User interface (UI) zone
* Management zone (for providers)
* Database Operations zone

/////

The following diagram shows an example of a highly available database configuration that contains worker appliances, providers, and the HAProxy load balancer configured in xref:configuring_HAProxy[]. 

The worker appliances in the diagram are labeled by server role (*User Interface*, *Management*, and *Database Ops*) and corresponding zone to show how a highly available environment might be scaled with server roles and zones.
